# spotify-end-end-data-pipeline
### Intoduction
In this project, we will build an ETL(Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using spontify API on AWS. The pipeline will retrive data from spontify API, transform it to desire format and load it into an AWS data storage and will perform analysis on data.
